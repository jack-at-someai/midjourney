# Midjourney Tools

Manual coded tools for accessing and interacting with Midjourney. Built to handle prompt generation, image retrieval, job management, and other Midjourney workflows without relying on third-party wrappers.

## Planned Features

- **Prompt Builder** — Structured prompt composition with parameter support (`--ar`, `--v`, `--style`, `--chaos`, etc.)
- **Image Retrieval** — Fetch and organize generated images by job ID
- **Job Management** — Track, queue, and manage generation jobs
- **Batch Operations** — Run bulk prompt variations and parameter sweeps
- **Gallery Viewer** — Local viewer for browsing and comparing outputs

## Status

Early development — scaffolding and core utilities coming soon.
